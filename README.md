# PythonSnake
A simple snake game I'm working on as a side project

This project is based on [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5F-aGDIYaM&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAjkwJocj7vlc_mFU-4wXJq).
I wanted to get some experience using pygame, since that's what my group is planning on using for our summative. 
I originally followed along with the lesson, but then decided to take a different turn, change some functions around, and add some features.

For example, this snake game now had a high score counter. (Note that it will always be my high score, I haven't figured out a way to 
clear it yet but will be working on that soon as well)

It's still very much a work in progress, and the code is far from where I think I can make it. I plan on commenting my code as soon as it's
at a point I'm satisfied with. 

Please excuse the terrible graphics that I drew very basically in MS Paint. I'm not much of an artist.
